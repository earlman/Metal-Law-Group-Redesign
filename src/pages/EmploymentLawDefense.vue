				<p>
					When it comes to employee issues, avoiding a lawsuit in the first place is always the first choice. Right or wrong if your business gets sued, you’ve already lost. Why? Because even if best case scenario you “win,”the case you will still have pay your lawyers to defend you and spend valuable time away from your business and family to prove you are right.
					This is the best case scenario.
					If you lose, you pay your attorneys, the damages awarded to the employee AND, worst of all, the employees attorneys!
					Yes you read that right. If you lose you have to pay the bills for the attorneys on the other side which is usually the biggest expense in all of this.
					We help you avoid employee problems in the first place before they become full blown devastating lawsuits. We have developed tactics to not only help keep you out of court but also put some pressure back on the employees so you are not always the one on the defensive.
